# Home Lab

This home lab serves as a sandbox for building and managing a domain environment, conducting red- and blue-team exercises, simulating attacks, and experimenting with SOC operations.  
This section documents the components, structure, and services of my personal home-lab environment. It includes everything from hardware details and server configurations to network designs, IP plans, and internal services. Below you’ll find:

1. Documentation Index: what’s planned & built  
2. Initial Setup Walkthrough: step-by-step guides  
3. Architecture Overview: final network diagrams & IP plans
