Documentation: https://github.com/nextcloud/all-in-one#nextcloud-all-in-one

## Prerequisites
First I installed docker on the vm. According to the documentation, docker must not be installed via snap and referred to the [docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/#supported-platforms)
