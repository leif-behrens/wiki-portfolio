<h1>Sysmon</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>General</h2>
<p>Sysmon (short for <i>System Monitor</i>) is a Windows system service and device driver. It remains resident across system reboots to monitor and log system activity to the <i>Windows Event Log.</i>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It provides detailed Information about:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Process creations</li>
  <li>Network connections</li>
  <li>Changes to file creation time</li>
  <li>And many more</li>
</ul>
<p>Sysmon requires a config file to tell the binary how to analyze the events it is receiving. <a href="https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config">Here</a> is an example of a high-quality config that works well for identifying anomalies.</p>
