# Ubuntu Client

ubunut-clt-01

Installation everything default (I had to boot from ISO, then chose try ubuntu or install). After I chose this, I got my desktop really quick. I didn't though about it that this is actually not installed yes (I didn't enter the installation wizard and had no opportunity to select the disk etc.) and rebooted the machine and wondered, after I ejected the iso, why this machine didn't boot. Then I restarted the whole process but chose the icon on the desktop to install ubuntu.
