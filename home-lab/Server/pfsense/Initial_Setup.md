# Initial Setup of the pfSense

## Creation of the Network Bridges in Proxmox
According to my [network design](/home-lab/Infrastructure/Network_Designs/Iteration_1) I created the following network bridges. I navigated to *Datacenter > proxmox01 > System > Network* and created an empty bridge with comments for each bridge.
