# Installation pfSense VM

**Date:** 2025-06-28
**pfSense-Version:** 2.7.2
**Proxmox-Version:** 8.

## Steps
### 1. Download ISO
I navigated to the [mirros page](https://atxfiles.netgate.com/mirror/downloads/) of netgate  so I didnt have to create an account.
Checked the hashes and wanted to etract the gzip file with the windows built-in unpacker. I received an Directory instead of the iso. I figured that maybe a dedicated program like 7zip is a better option for unpacking archived files and it worked. I uploaded the ISO to my proxmox.

### 2. VM creation



3. NICs
