Installation everything default (I had to boot from ISO, then chose try ubuntu or install). After I chose this, I got my desktop really quick. I didn't though about it that this is actually not installed yes (I didn't enter the installation wizard and had no opportunity to select the disk etc.) and rebooted the machine and wondered, after I ejected the iso, why this machine didn't boot. Then I restarted the whole process but chose the icon on the desktop to install ubuntu.

After another try I faced another issue that during the installation process the screen froze and the CPU usage was > 100%. Then I stopped the installation process by shutting down the vm, increased the number of CPU cores from 1 to 3 (just temporarily for the installation) und restarted the process. Same issue so I temporarily increased the RAM from 2 GiB to 4 GiB and then the installation was successful. Afterwards I decreased the number of CPU cores to 1 and the RAM to 2 GiB again.
